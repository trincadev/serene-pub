Welcome to Serene Pub for macOS!

Thank you for downloading Serene Pub.

To run the app:

1. Extract the archive to your preferred location.

2. Open the Terminal app.

3. Navigate to the extracted folder (e.g., serene-pub-<version>-macos):
      cd /path/to/serene-pub-<version>-macos

4. Run the app with:
      bash run.sh

5. Node.js runtime is included - no installation or download required! The application will start immediately.

6. To stop the application, press Ctrl+C in the terminal window.

7. Optional Configuration:
   - Copy ".env.example" to ".env" to customize settings
   - Edit ".env" to set custom data directory: SERENE_PUB_DATA_DIR=/path/to/data
   - Change server ports: SOCKETS_PORT=3001, PORT=3000
   - Disable auto-browser opening: SERENE_AUTO_OPEN=1

8. On your Mac, access Serene Pub from http://localhost:3000.

Notes:
- Serene Pub will attempt to automatically identify your local network IP address, allowing access across other devices (e.g. mobile phones.)
    - To find your local IP, run: hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'
    - For example, if the result is 192.168.1.42, you can access Serene Pub from your phone at http://192.168.1.42:3000

Troubleshooting:
- If you get a permission error, run: chmod +x run.sh
- If your system does not have curl or a supported terminal, install curl (brew install curl) or use the terminal method above.
