Welcome to Serene Pub for Windows!

Thank you for downloading Serene Pub.

To run the app:

1. Extract the archive to your preferred location.
2. Open the extracted folder (e.g., serene-pub-<version>-win).
3. Double-click the "run.ps1" file to start Serene Pub.

   - The first launch will automatically download and set up Node.js if needed. No manual installation is required.
   - The launcher will automatically detect your Windows architecture (x64 or ARM64) and download the appropriate Node.js version.

4. Optional Configuration:
   - Copy ".env.example" to ".env" to customize settings
   - Edit ".env" to set custom data directory: SERENE_PUB_DATA_DIR=C:\path\to\data
   - Change server ports: SOCKETS_PORT=3001, PORT=3000
   - Disable auto-browser opening: SERENE_AUTO_OPEN=1

5. On your Windows PC, access Serene Pub from http://0.0.0.0:3000 or http://localhost:3000.

Notes:
- Serene Pub will attempt to automatically identify your local network IP address, allowing access across other devices (e.g. mobile phones.)
    - To find your local IP, open Command Prompt and run: ipconfig
    - Look for the "IPv4 Address" under your active network adapter (e.g., 192.168.1.42). You can access Serene Pub from your phone at http://<your-ip>:3000

Troubleshooting:
- If double-clicking "run.ps1" does not start the app, try right-clicking and selecting "Run with PowerShell."
- If you see a PowerShell execution policy warning, the script will automatically adjust the policy for the current session.
- If you see a security warning, click "More info" and then "Run anyway."
- If Node.js fails to download, check your internet connection or firewall settings.

Uninstall:
- To remove Serene Pub, simply delete the extracted folder. No files are installed outside this directory.
