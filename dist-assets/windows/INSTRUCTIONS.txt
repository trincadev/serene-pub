Notes:
- Serene Pub will attempt to automatically identify your local network IP address, allowing access across other devices (e.g. mobile phones.)
    - To find your local IP, open Command Prompt and run: ipconfig
    - Look for the "IPv4 Address" under your active network adapter (e.g., 192.168.1.42). You can access Serene Pub from your phone at http://<your-ip>:3000

Troubleshooting:
- If double-clicking "run.cmd" does not start the app, you may need to run it as administrator
- Ensure all files were extracted properly from the ZIP archive
- This is open source software - you can review all code at https://github.com/doolijb/serene-pub

Uninstall:
- To remove Serene Pub, simply delete the extracted folder. No files are installed outside this directory.
