To set up the application icon:

1. Convert favicon.png to favicon.ico using an online converter
2. Use Resource Hacker (http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/) to:
   - Open "Serene Pub Launcher.bat"
   - Add the favicon.ico as the application icon
   - Save as "Serene Pub.exe"

Or use a batch-to-exe converter that supports custom icons.
