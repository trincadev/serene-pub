Welcome to Serene Pub for Linux!

Thank you for downloading Serene Pub.

To run the app:

1. Extract the archive to your preferred location.
2. Choose one of the following ways to start the app:

   a) Graphical (no terminal required):
      - In your file manager, right-click the "run.sh" file.
      - Select "Properties" and ensure "Allow executing file as program" (or similar) is checked. Save and close the dialog.
      - Right-click the "run.sh" icon again and choose "Run as program" (wording may vary by desktop environment).
      - This will open a terminal and start the app.

   b) Terminal method:
      - Open a terminal window.
      - Navigate to the extracted folder (e.g., serene-pub-<version>-linux):

            cd /path/to/serene-pub-<version>-linux

      - Run the app with:

            bash run.sh

      - If you get a permission error, run: chmod +x run.sh

3. Node.js runtime is included - no installation or download required! The application will start immediately.

4. To stop the application, press Ctrl+C in the terminal window.

5. Optional Configuration:
   - Copy ".env.example" to ".env" to customize settings
   - Edit ".env" to set custom data directory: SERENE_PUB_DATA_DIR=/path/to/data
   - Change server ports: SOCKETS_PORT=3001, PORT=3000
   - Disable auto-browser opening: SERENE_AUTO_OPEN=1

5. On your host machine, access Serene Pub from http://0.0.0.0:3000 or http://localhost:3000.

Notes:
- Serene Pub will attempt to automatically identify your local network IP address, allowing access across other devices (e.g. mobile phones.)
    - If you run " hostname -I | awk '{print $1}' " in the terminal and the result is 192.168.68.69, 
    then you can access Serene Pub from your phone by navigating to http://192.168.68.69:3000

Troubleshooting:
- If double-clicking "Serene Pub" does not open a terminal, try the terminal method above.
- If you see a message about missing permissions, run: chmod +x run.sh
- If your system does not have curl or a supported terminal, install curl (sudo apt install curl) or use the terminal method above.
