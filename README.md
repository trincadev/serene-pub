## üìö Documentation & Help

### üß© Context Configuration

Serene Pub uses Handlebars-style templates to build highly customizable prompts. Templates can include dynamic information like date, world lore, and structured history. Example:

````hbs
{{#systemBlock}}
	Instructions: """
	{{#if currentDate}}
		The current date in the story is {{{currentDate}}}.
	{{/if}}

	{{{instructions}}}
	""" Assistant Characters (AI-controlled): ```json
	{{{characters}}}
	``` User Characters (player-controlled): ```json
	{{{personas}}}
	``` Scenario: """ {{{scenario}}} """

	{{#if worldLore}}
		World lore: ```json
		{{{worldLore}}}
		```
	{{/if}}

	{{#if history}}
		Story history: ```json
		{{{history}}}
		```
	{{/if}}

	{{#if exampleDialogue}}
		{{{exampleDialogue}}}
	{{/if}}
{{/systemBlock}}

{{#each chatMessages}}
	{{#if (eq role "assistant")}}
		{{#assistantBlock}}
			{{{name}}}: {{{message}}}
		{{/assistantBlock}}
	{{/if}}

	{{#if (eq role "user")}}
		{{#userBlock}}
			{{{name}}}: {{{message}}}
		{{/userBlock}}
	{{/if}}
{{/each}}

{{#if postHistoryInstructions}}
	{{#systemBlock}}
		{{{postHistoryInstructions}}}
	{{/systemBlock}}
{{/if}}
````

### üìù Prompt Configuration

Prompt Configurations define the tone and behavior of the AI's responses. These instructions are sent alongside your message history and context blocks.

Example:

```text
Develop the plot slowly, always stay in character. Describe all actions in full, elaborate, explicit, graphic, and vivid detail. Mention all relevant sensory perceptions. Keep the story immersive and engaging.
```

### üë§ Personas

Personas are user-controlled characters. Give your persona a name, description, and avatar to represent yourself in chats. Personas let you roleplay as different characters, each with their own style and background.

### ü§ñ Characters

Characters are AI-controlled participants in your chats. Each character can have a name, description, avatar, personality, and greeting.

- **Greeting:** The greeting is the first message a character inserts into the chat. It helps ground the AI and provides an example of how the character should behave. You can add additional greetings or group-only greetings for more variety.
- **Importing:** Character cards can be imported from Silly Tavern or your favorite character card website, making it easy to bring your favorite personalities into Serene Pub.

### üìñ Lorebooks+

Lorebooks+ are advanced worldbuilding and context management tools that let you deeply enrich your roleplay experience. With Lorebooks+, you can:

- **Character Bindings:** Hotswappable characters linked in the lorebook. Dynamically update character and persona names in lorebook entries, so the right information is injected into the prompt for the current cast of your chat.
- **World Lore:** Store and organize facts, rules, and background information about your world, setting, or universe. World lore can be automatically included in relevant chats.
    - _Imported lorebooks/world books are inserted into "world lore" for easy access and editing._
- **Character Lore:** Linked to character bindings and extends the character profiles. Maintain detailed backstories, traits, and secrets for each character, ensuring the AI stays consistent and in-character.
- **History:** Track and inject important story events, chat history, or evolving facts as the narrative progresses. _History entries are experimental and may change in future releases._ This helps maintain continuity and depth in long-running stories.

To use a lorebook, select it when creating or editing a chat. Lorebook entries are triggered by keywords, but may also be pinned to ensure they are always present in the prompt. Vectorization will be added in the future as a replacement for keyword engineering, making context injection smarter and more flexible.

Lorebooks+ make it easy to manage complex worlds, keep characters consistent, and ensure the AI always has the right context for immersive storytelling.

### üí¨ Chats

Create a chat by adding one or more characters and at least one persona. You can:

- Optionally add a scenario to tell the AI what the current objective is. In non-group chats, this overrides character scenarios.
- Enable or disable characters from responding automatically in group chats for more control over the conversation flow.
- Optionally select a lorebook to inject world, character, or historical lore into your chat for richer context and storytelling.

### üè∑Ô∏è Tags (Coming in 0.4.0)

Tags are a planned feature for the 0.4.0 release. Tags will help you organize and filter your content, making it easier to manage complex stories and worlds.

### üìÇ Data Location

Your data is saved locally in your OS-specific app directory:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/SerenePub`
- **Windows:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SerenePub`
- **Linux:** `~/.local/share/SerenePub`

### ‚ö° Troubleshooting

- Adjust "Context Tokens" in the Sampling tab.
- Configure a more accurate tokenizer in the Connections sidebar.
- Use the "View Prompt Statistics" modal to preview your final prompt.

* Save your configuration to apply changes.
* Default templates marked with `*` cannot be edited directly; clone to customize.

- Ensure you are editing a cloned configuration, not the defaults.

### üîå Connections

Serene Pub supports a variety of AI model connections, both local and cloud-based. For a full list of currently supported (or in development) connection options, see the [Supported Connections Issue](https://github.com/doolijb/serene-pub/issues/10).

- **Connection Types:** Some adapters support chat APIs, completion APIs, or both. You can mix and match connections to suit your needs. When using completion APIs (Serene Pub precompiles the entire prompt), you can select from available prompt formats to best match your model's requirements.
- **Token Counter:** Each connection uses a token counter to estimate the number of tokens in your chat history, character definitions, and prompt. This helps manage context size and avoid exceeding model limits.
- **Setup:** Add and configure connections in the app sidebar. Test connections and refresh available models directly from the UI.

---

## üß™ Unit Testing

Serene Pub uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing.  
All unit tests are organized in a dedicated folder: `tests/unit` at the project root. This keeps test code separate from production code and makes it easier to manage and scale your test suite.

### Folder Structure

```bash
serene-pub/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ unit/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...your unit test files (.test.ts)...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vitest.config.ts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Running Tests

To run all unit tests:

```sh
npm run test
```

or

```sh
npx vitest
```

### Writing Tests

Tests use the Vitest API (`describe`, `it`, `expect`). Example test for a utility function:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { add } from '$lib/utils';

describe('add', () => {
  it('adds two numbers', () => {
    expect(add(2, 3)).toBe(5);
  });
});
```

### Test Coverage

- Token counting strategies are thoroughly tested in `tests/unit/lib/server/utils/TokenCounterManager.test.ts`
- Svelte components and utilities can be tested using [@testing-library/svelte](https://testing-library.com/docs/svelte-testing-library/intro/)

If you add new features or fix bugs, please include or update relevant tests in the `tests/unit` folder!
